   This is a project about hotel booking system. An user can book a hotel without any extra problem. This website design is very user friendly.

* Login and Logout system-
  This website has a dynamic login and logout system with firebase. Your login credentials will be validated in the firebase. After successfully login user will get extra service from this website .

* Implemented JWT(jsonWebToken) system-
  This website has a high security level for user. Json web token will keep secure the users data. No one can access other users data. Only same user can get same users data.

* Can sort rooms by price-
  User can see available rooms in the Rooms page. And the rooms are showing randomly that means those are not sorted . User can sort rooms by clicking on SORT BY PRICE button from high price to low price.

* Can't book unavailable rooms-
  User only can book the available rooms in this website. If there is a room unavailable then user will not be able to book that room. And if you book a available room then the quantity of the rooms will be decreased.

* Can cancel a book-
  After completed the booking user will be able to see the booking lists in my booking page. And user can delete the booking if user want.

* Can not cancel a booking before 1 day ago from booked date-
  User has the access to delete a booking that user booked before. But one condition is that before 1 day from the booked date user can not delete or cancel the booking.
